# EF Core In-Memory Database Provider

This database provider allows Entity Framework Core to be used with an in-memory database. The in-memory database can be useful for testing, although the SQLite provider in in-memory mode may be a more appropriate test replacement for relational databases. The in-memory database is designed for testing only. The provider is maintained as part of the [Entity Framework Core Project](https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore).

## Install

Install the [Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.InMemory NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.InMemory/).

### [.NET Core CLI](#tab/dotnet-core-cli)

```dotnetcli
dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.InMemory
```

### [Visual Studio](#tab/vs)
