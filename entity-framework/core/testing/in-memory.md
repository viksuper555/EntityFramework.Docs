# Testing with the EF In-Memory Database

> [!WARNING]
> The EF in-memory database often behaves differently than relational databases.
> Only use the EF in-memory database after fully understanding the issues and trade-offs involved, as discussed in [Testing code that uses EF Core](xref:core/testing/index).  

> [!TIP]
> SQLite is a relational provider and can also use in-memory databases.
> Consider using this for testing to more closely match common relational database behaviors.
> This is covered in [Using SQLite to test an EF Core application](xref:core/testing/sqlite).
